             -----------------------------------  2010 by buck and 0xtob



This is a quick poof of concept demo fora lightweight OpenGL library running
on the Arduino. It was developed using th Arduino IDE version 022 and an
Arduino Uno.

Here's what it looks like: http://youtu.be/watch?v=i3MdzMGuSo8

To use this demo, you need an Arduino (http://arduino.cc) and a LOLShield
(http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/). To build it, use the enclosed
Makefile.

Feel free to use the OpenGL library in your own projects!

Have fun!
